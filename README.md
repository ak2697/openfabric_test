# Science Chatbot
This is a chatbot that can answer questions related to elementary science topics, using NLP to identify the intent of the question and searching for information on Wikipedia to provide a response.

Used wikipedia API to search the topics and return the answer.
I have also used NLP, to get the core of the sentence and answer accordingly.
